\subsection{DES}
\label{sec:encoding:des}

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher algorithm based on Feistel networks and 6x4 S-boxes. It was the NBS standard for cryptography between 1977 and the early 2000s, when brute force attacks on its 56-bit key started to become feasible.\cite{Simmons16}

DES normally takes place in 16 rounds. In 2007, Bard and Cortois\cite{CB07} developed a generic attack on 6x4 S-boxes, which they applied with MiniSat2 to solve 6 rounds of DES.  We used their ANF files, available on Courtois's site\footnote{http://www.cryptosystem.net/aes/toyciphers.html}. We converted these ANF files into CNF files with XOR constraints using Soos and Bettale's anf2cnf tool\footnote{https://gitorious.org/anf2cnf/anf2cnf.git/}, and the xor\_to\_cnf tool in Soos's cnf-utils\cite{SNC09}\footnote{https://github.com/msoos/cnf-utils} to make CNF files without XORs. We found that even MiniSat2 could solve 6 rounds in under a second on our hardware. This is likely because of large hardware improvements, since Courtois and Bard originally used a 1.6GHz desktop machine, while DAVinCI is a supercomputing cluster with 2.83GHz CPUs. To compensate, we instead converted and solved another ANF they had provided for attacking 8 rounds of DES with 16 chosen plaintexts to provide a more difficult problem with which to compare solvers. We solved the resulting SAT formula 100 times per solver and took the median.
