\subsection{The Crypto-1 Stream-Cipher}
The Crypto-1 stream cipher is a simple cipher designed to have a minimal hardware footprint. In 2009, Soos et. al \cite{SNC09} developed an encoding of Crypto-1 into a SAT formula containing both CNF and XOR clauses. Further, they were able to solve these formulas with only 56 bits of known key-stream. One result of this work was Grain of Salt\footnote{http://www.msoos.org/grain-of-salt/}, a tool which can generate SAT formulas for a variety of shift register-based stream ciphers.

Using Grain of Salt, we generated 100 encodings of the Crypto-1 cipher with 56 bits of key-stream each.
