\section{Attacking the Crypto-1 stream-cipher}
The Crypto-1 stream cipher is a simple cipher designed to have a minimal hardware footprint. We were able to solve the Crypto-1 cipher with 56 bits of known keystream. We generated 10 versions of the Crypto-1 cipher with Grain of Salt \footnote{http://www.msoos.org/grain-of-salt/}, a tool which can generate SAT formulas for a variety of shift register-based stream ciphers. We ran each solver on all 10 formulas and reported the average run time in Table \ref{table:crypto1:runtime}.

Compared to Soos et. al \cite{SNC09}, we observe a 2.6x speedup from hardware improvements alone. Moreover, Glucose was able to achieve a 1.4x speedup relative to the MiniSat. CryptoMiniSat performed similarly to Glucose without Gaussian elimination of XOR clauses. With Gaussian elimination, we achieved another 2x speedup.
