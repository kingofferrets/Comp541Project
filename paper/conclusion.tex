\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The ``SAT revolution'' has driven heavy improvement in other areas, but this benefit has not reached the field of algebraic cryptanalysis. While hardware improvements over attacks from 10 years ago have been significant, it's unclear whether modern SAT solvers are generally better at all than those from 10 years ago. Instead, different SAT solvers using different heuristics are better or worse at different cryptanalytic problems.

These mixed results give little reason to run newer SAT solvers over older in cryptanalytic experiments. In all experiments we ran, all of the results were within an order of magnitude of each other, so running multiple SAT solvers in parallel is unlikely to be a significant performance gain as some terminate early. Instead, future attempts at cryptanalysis using SAT solving should focus on finding particular SAT solvers and configurations that are effective on the problems they face, and on improving SAT solvers with new heuristics designed for those problems.
