\section{Project Milestones}
\label{sec:milestones}

In the development of this project, we covered three major milestones. Note that we added Jonathan as a group member shortly after the initial project proposal and redistributed the work at that time.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item By March 16th, we prepared our toolset for the analysis. In particular, we set up the three SAT solvers listed in Section \ref{sec:related:solvers} on the Rice DAVinCI cluster.
	
	\item By March 30th, we completed the attack by Soos et. al \cite{SNC09} listed above. We will work together on this task, each finding optimal parameters for a single solver. Jeffrey handled MiniSat, Jonathan handled Glucose, and Corey handled CryptoMiniSat.
	
	\item By April 22nd, we completed the other three attacks. Jeffrey replicated the attack by De at. al \cite{DKV07}, Corey replicated the attack by Courtois and Bard \cite{CB07}, and Jonathan replicated the attack by Morawiecki and Srebrny \cite{MS13}.
\end{enumerate}
